# Audiostreamer-App
An audio streaming application that looks similar to Spotify
Build an audio streaming application on android. 

I use the ExoPlayer library for streaming the audio files. The audio files are located online in a Firebase Firestore database.

Here's what you will see in the course:

ExoPlayer (same media library used by YouTube in the mobile app)
Streaming audio files from the internet (Firestore)
Playlists
Effective fragment management
AsyncTasks
SharedPreferences
Effective communication with interfaces
Services (a class specifically built to stream media files)
Background Services that run forever
Notifications
Controlling playback through a notification
Notifications and the lock screen
Broadcast Receivers
Glide library to download bitmaps
RecyclerViews
